# Data structures
> [!NOTE]
> Dat structure are building blocks program for for organizing and storing data. It provides a way to efficiently access, insert, and delete data elements.

## Abstract Data Type (ADT): 
An abstract definition of a data structure focusing on its operations and behavior without revealing its implementation details.

# Data structures Types: 

Data structures can be categorized into linear, non-linear, and hierarchical based on their organization and relationships between elements.
+ Linear Data structures
  + Static Data structures
    + Array
  + Dynamic Data structures
    + List
    + Stack
    + Queue
+ Non Linear Data structures
  + Trees
  + Graphs
##  
> Arrays

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Fixed-size contiguous memory locations storing data of the same type. Efficient for random access and traversing elements sequentially.

> Linked Lists

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Nodes containing data and a reference to the next node in the list. Offer flexibility in adding and removing elements but slower random access.

> Stacks

> [!IMPORTANT]
> LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure where elements are added and removed from the top. Efficient for backtracking and function calls.

> Queues

> [!IMPORTANT]
> FIFO (First In First Out) data structure where elements are added to the back and removed from the front. Useful for processing data in a sequential order.

> Trees

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Hierarchical structures with nodes containing data and references to child nodes. Efficient for searching and sorting data.

> Graphs

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Networks of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. Useful for modeling relationships and connections between entities.
