# Array

> Arrays are like containers that hold multiple items of the same type in one place. It allows to store multiple items in a single variable.

> [!NOTE]
> An array is a fundamental data structure in computer science. 
> It is a collection of elements of the same type that are stored at contiguous memory locations.

# Basic Array Operations: 
+ Array Traversal: Iterating through an array and performing operations.
+ Array Modification: Modifying elements at specific indices or based on certain conditions.
+ Finding Maximum/Minimum: Finding the largest or smallest element in an array.
+ Reversing an Array: Reversing the order of elements in an array.

# Searching and Sorting: 
+ Linear Search: Searching for an element in an array sequentially.
+ Binary Search: Searching for an element in a sorted array by dividing the search interval in half.

# Searching and Sorting: 
+ Subarray Problems: Finding maximum/minimum sum subarray, contiguous subarrays with specific properties.
  + Contiguous subarrays are sequences of elements within an array that are contiguous or adjacent to each other, meaning they appear in a sequence without any gaps. 
  + Problems related to contiguous subarrays involve finding, counting, or manipulating these continuous sections within an array.

+ Two Pointer Problem: Problems involving two pointers moving through an array simultaneously.
  + The Two Pointer Technique is a powerful algorithmic technique commonly used to solve problems involving arrays or sequences. 
  + It utilizes two pointers (indexes or references) that typically move through the array in a particular fashion to solve the problem efficiently.

# Advanced Topics: 
## Dynamic Programming with Arrays
> Dynamic Programming (DP) is a powerful optimization technique used to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems. 
> 
> It works by storing the solutions to these subproblems to avoid redundant computations.
## Sliding Window Technique
> The Sliding Window Technique is a powerful computational technique used to efficiently solve problems involving arrays, strings, or other data structures. 
> 
> It works by maintaining a "window" of a fixed size that slides through the data, performing operations on the elements within the window at each step.
