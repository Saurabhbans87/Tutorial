# Monotonic Stack
A monotonic stack is a variation of a stack that maintains a specific order of elements, either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing, as elements are pushed onto it. 
The main idea is to preserve this order to efficiently find the next greater or smaller element for each element in an array.

# Key Features
+ Increasing Monotonic Stack
  + It is a stack in which the elements are in increasing order from the bottom to the top of the stack.
+ Decreasing Monotonic Stack
  + It is a stack in which the elements are in decreasing order from the bottom to the top of the stack.
# Applications
+ Finding Next Greater/Smaller Elements
  + Efficiently find the next greater or smaller element for each element in an array using monotonic stacks.
+ Histogram Area Calculation
  + Calculate the largest rectangular area in a histogram using a decreasing monotonic stack.
+ Stock Span Problem
  + Solve the stock span problem, where the task is to find the span (number of consecutive days) for which the stock price was less than or equal to the current day's price.
