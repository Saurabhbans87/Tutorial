## Singly linked list
A singly linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements called nodes. Each node contains two parts: data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. 
The last node in the list points to null, indicating the end of the list.

## Singly linked list components 
Here are the main components of a singly linked list:

Node: Each node in a singly linked list contains two fields:

Data: Holds the actual value or data being stored.
Next: A reference to the next node in the list.
Head: The head of the singly linked list is a reference to the first node in the list. It allows traversal from the beginning of the list.
Empty List: An empty singly linked list has a null head pointer.
