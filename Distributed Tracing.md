## Distributed Tracing
In distributed system, each service involved in processing a request is tagged with a unique identifier. As the request passes through these services, they add information (metadata) about their actions and duration, allowing you to reconstruct the complete journey of the request. This helps in understanding performance bottlenecks, troubleshooting errors, and optimizing the system's behavior.

By collecting and analyzing this tracing data, you can gain insights into how requests flow through your system, identify where issues occur, and optimize the performance of individual services to ensure a smooth and efficient journey for your requests.
