## Distributed Tracing
```
It is latency measurement of each service in distributed system or microservice architecture.
```
In distributed system, each service involved in processing a request is tagged with a unique identifier. As the request passes through these services, they add information (metadata) about their actions and duration, allowing you to reconstruct the complete journey of the request. This helps in understanding performance bottlenecks, troubleshooting errors, and optimizing the system's behavior.
