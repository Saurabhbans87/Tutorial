# Spring Cloud

> [!NOTE]
> Spring Cloud provides tools for developers to quickly build some of the common patterns in distributed systems

Spring Cloud is a collection of tools and frameworks built on top of the Spring Framework to simplify the development of distributed systems and microservices-based applications. 

It provides solutions to common challenges encountered in building cloud-native applications, offering a set of components that address various aspects of distributed systems.

# Spring Cloud Features
> Service Discovery

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Service Discovery allows dynamic registration and discovery of microservices. It enables applications to find and communicate with each other without hardcoding service locations.

>Distributed Tracing

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Distributed tracing helps track and monitor requests as they traverse multiple services, providing insights into request paths, performance, and dependencies between services.

>Circuit Breakers

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Circuit breakers help prevent cascading failures in distributed systems by isolating failing services, thereby improving system resilience.

>API Gateway

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Provides a centralized entry point for clients, routing requests to various services and handling cross-cutting concerns like authentication, rate limiting, and monitoring.
